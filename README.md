Markcop is our friendly Markdown enforcer.

## Contributing

This is a guide to creating your own check.

1. Add a function that takes the file name as the its first argument, and the
   file contents as the second

   ```bash
   # Markdown checking functions

   function my_check {
     file_name="$1"
     my_check_errors_in_file=false
     for line in $(echo "$2"); do
       my_check_errors_in_file=true
       # Failed checks should print red 'x's
       printf "${RED}x${NC}"
       errors="${errors}\n${line} fails my_check!"
     done

     if [ $my_check_errors_in_file = true ]; then
       return 1
     fi

     # Successful checks should print green dots
     printf "${GREEN}.${NC}"
     return 0
   }
   ```

2. Add the function name to the `CHECKS` array

   ```
   CHECKS=(my_check
           trailing_whitespace
           malformed_header
           header_missing_newline
           long_line
           missing_link
           eof_newline)
   ```

## Running It

Copy and paste the following into your terminal (must have Docker installed):

    docker run -v $(pwd):/app hackclub/markcop

If you'd rather run it directly without docker, run the following:

    curl -sL https://git.io/vswrY | bash

If you're worried about piping from the internet to bash (which you should be),
you can run Markcop manually by downloading `bin/markcop` and running it
manually.

## Development

Run the following to run Markcop in its Docker container in development (make
sure to run this from the root of the repo):

    docker run -v $(pwd):/app -v $(pwd)/bin:/markcop hackclub/markcop
